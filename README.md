# open_agb_firm
open_agb_firm is a bare metal interface for *natively* running GBA games and homebrew using the 3DS's built-in GBA hardware.

open_agb_firm is also a complete and better alternative to GBA VC injects (AGB_FIRM), allowing for:
* Launching GBA files directly from the SD card
* Writing save files directly to the SD card
* Automatic save type configuration using an included database
* User configuration, such as gamma settings
* Button remapping
* Border support for 1:1 scaling mode
* And more to come!

## Disclaimer
open_agb_firm is currently in alpha. While open_agb_firm is relatively stable and safe to use, some quirks that have not been fixed. See [Known Issues](#known-issues) for more information.

Additionally, we are not responsible for any damage that may occur to your system as a direct or indirect result of you using open_agb_firm.

## Setup
* Download the [latest release](https://github.com/profi200/open_agb_firm/releases/latest) and extract it.
* Copy the `open_agb_firm.firm` file to your 3DS's SD card at `/luma/payloads` if you're using Luma3DS or elsewhere if you're using fastboot3DS.
* Copy the `3ds` folder to the root of your 3DS's SD card. Merge folders if asked.
* Launch open_agb_firm using Luma3DS by holding START while booting your 3DS or assign it to a slot if you're using fastboot3DS.
* After open_agb_firm launches, use the file browser to navigate to a `.gba` ROM to run.

## Controls
A/B/L/R/START/SELECT - GBA buttons, respectively

SELECT+Y - Dump hardware frame output to `/3ds/open_agb_firm/screenshots/YYYY_MM_DD_HH_MM_SS.bmp`
* The file name is the current date and time from your real-time clock.
* If the screen output freezes, press HOME to fix it. This is a hard to track down bug that will be fixed.

X+UP/DOWN - Adjust screen brightness up or down by `backlightSteps` units.

X+LEFT - Turn off LCD backlight.

X+RIGHT - Turn on LCD backlight.

Hold the X button while launching a game to skip applying patches (if present)

Hold the power button to turn off the 3DS.

## Configuration
Settings are stored in `/3ds/open_agb_firm/config.ini`.

### General
General settings.

`u8 backlight` - Backlight brightness in luminance (cd/m²)
* Default: `64`
* Possible values:
  * Old 3DS: `20`-`117`
  * New 3DS: `16`-`142`
* Values ≤`64` are recommended.
* Hardware calibration from your CTRNAND is required to get the correct brightness for both LCDs.

`u8 backlightSteps` - How much to adjust backlight brightness by
* Default: `5`

`bool directBoot` - Skip GBA BIOS intro at game startup
* Default: `false`

`bool useGbaDb` - Use `gba_db.bin` to get save types
* Default: `true`

### Video
Video-related settings.

`u8 scaler` - Video scaler. 0 = none, 1 = bilinear, 2 = hardware.
* Default: `2`

`float gbaGamma` - GBA input gamma
* Default: `2.2`

`float lcdGamma` - Output LCD gamma
* Default : `1.54`

`float contrast` - Screen gain
* Default: `1.0`

`float brightness` - Screen lift
* Default: `0.0`

`string colorProfile` - Color correction profile. `none`, `gba`, `nds` or `nds_white`.
* Default: `none`
* For the gba profile it's recommended to adjust lcdGamma to match a GBA. For New 3DS XL with IPS LCD roughly 1.8 is good.
* Due to most 2/3DS LCDs not being calibrated correctly from factory the look may not match exactly what you see on a real GBA.
* Due to a lot of extra RAM access and up to 6.3 ms (worst case for scaler=2) of extra CPU processing time per frame, battery run time is affected with color profiles other than none.

### Audio
Audio settings.

`u8 audioOut` - Audio output. 0 = auto, 1 = speakers, 2 = headphones.
* Default: `0`

`s8 volume` - Audio volume. Values above 48 mean control via volume slider. Range -128 (muted) to -20 (100%). Avoid the range -19 to 48.
* Default: `127`

### Input
Input settings. Each entry allows one or multiple buttons. Buttons are separated by a `,` without spaces.  
Allowed buttons are `A B SELECT START RIGHT LEFT UP DOWN R L X Y TOUCH CP_RIGHT CP_LEFT CP_UP CP_DOWN`.  
TOUCH reacts to all touchscreen presses. The CP in front is short for Circle-Pad.

Note that button mappings can cause input lag of up to 1 frame depending on when the game reads inputs. For this reason the default mapping of the Circle-Pad to D-Pad is no longer provided.

`A` - Button map for the A button.
* Default: `none`

`B` - Button map for the B button.
* Default: `none`

`SELECT` - Button map for the SELECT button.
* Default: `none`

`START` - Button map for the START button.
* Default: `none`

`RIGHT` - Button map for the RIGHT button.
* Default: `none`

`LEFT` - Button map for the LEFT button.
* Default: `none`

`UP` - Button map for the UP button.
* Default: `none`

`DOWN` - Button map for the DOWN button.
* Default: `none`

`R` - Button map for the R button.
* Default: `none`

`L` - Button map for the L button.
* Default: `none`

Example:
```
[input]
RIGHT=RIGHT,CP_RIGHT
LEFT=LEFT,CP_LEFT
UP=UP,CP_UP
DOWN=DOWN,CP_DOWN
```

### Game
Game-specific settings. Only intended to be used in the per-game settings (romName.ini in `/3ds/open_agb_firm/saves`).

`u8 saveSlot` - Savegame slot (0-9)
* Default: `0`

`u8 saveType` - Override to use a specific save type, see values for `defaultSave` (0-15, 255)
* Default: `255` (disabled)

### Advanced
Options for advanced users. No pun intended.

`bool saveOverride` - Open save type override menu after selecting a game
* Default: `false`

`u16 defaultSave` - Change save type default when save type is not in `gba_db.bin` and cannot be autodetected
* Default: `14` (SRAM 256k)
* Possible values:
  * `0`, `1`: EEPROM 8k
  * `2`, `3`: EEPROM 64k
  * `4`, `6`, `8`: Flash 512k RTC
  * `5`, `7`, `9`: Flash 512k
  * `10`, `12`: Flash 1m RTC
  * `11`, `13`: Flash 1m
  * `14`: SRAM 256k
  * `15`: None

## Patches
open_agb_firm supports automatically applying IPS and UPS patches. To use a patch, rename the patch file to match the ROM file name (without the extension).
* If you wanted to apply an IPS patch to `example.gba`, rename the patch file to `example.ips`

## Known Issues
This section is reserved for a listing of known issues. At present only this remains:
* Sleep mode is not fully implemented.
* Using SELECT+Y to dump screen output to a file can freeze the screen output sometimes.
* Save type autodetection may still fail for certain games using EEPROM.
* Lack of settings.
* No cheats and other enhancements.

If you happen to stumble over another bug, please [open an issue](https://github.com/profi200/open_agb_firm/issues) or contact profi200 via other platforms.

## Hardware Limitations
open_agb_firm using the 3DS's built-in GBA hardware. Unfortunately, this comes with limitations compared to GBA emulators. This is a list of limitations we can't solve in software or are very hard to work around.
* \>32 MiB (>256 Mbit) games and homebrew.
* Games with extra hardware built into the cartridge (except real-time clocks). Patches are required.
* Proper save autodetection (can't find save type during gameplay).
* GBA serial port (aka Link Cable).
* \>32 KiB (>256 Kbit) SRAM (homebrew games/emulators).
* Reboots are required for switching between games.
* No save states. Very difficult to implement because no direct hardware access.
* Sound has lots of aliasing issues. No known workaround (hardware bug).

## EEPROM Fixer
Most emulators output EEPROM saves differently than what open_agb_firm expects, making them incompatible. Fortunately, they are very easy to fix, using [this tool](https://exelotl.github.io/gba-eeprom-save-fix/) by exelotl.

The tool also works vise versa, if you want to use a save generated by open_agb_firm with an emulator.

## FAQ
**Q: Why isn't open_agb_firm a normal 3DS app?**\
A: To access the 3DS's GBA hardware, open_agb_firm needs to run with full hardware access, which can only be provided by running as a FIRM.

**Q: Is this safe to use?**\
A: Of course! While open_agb_firm does run with full hardware access, a lot of work has been put in by several people to ensure that nothing unexpected happens. Some backend code from open_agb_firm is actually used in [fastboot3ds](https://github.com/derrekr/fastboot3DS)!

**Q: What games work with open_agb_firm?**\
A: In theory, all of them, except those that fall within the [hardware limitations](#hardware-limitations).

**Q: How can I increase the brightness?**\
A: Increase the value of the `backlight` setting in `config.ini`. See [Configuration](#configuration) for more information.

**Q: Why do the colors look off?**\
A: The default gamma settings are intended to make up for the washed out colors the 3DS LCD has. If they look weird to you, setting the `outGamma` setting to `2.2` might help.

**Q: Why do some of my ROM hacks/homebrew games have saving issues?**\
A: open_agb_firm resorts to save autodetection when it can't find an entry for the game it's running in `gba_db.bin` (which only contains data for official games), and it's a bit wonky for games that use EEPROM or misleading SDK save strings.

**Q: Why doesn't my save file from an emulator work?**\
A: There's a good chance that the save you're having issues with is an EEPROM save, which most emulators output differently. See [EEPROM Fixer](#eeprom-fixer).

**Q: My game doesn't save properly!**\
A: First, please ensure that the GBA ROM you are playing is not modified in any way, and matches its [No-Intro](https://datomatic.no-intro.org/) checksums. Second, make sure you aren't using an existing `.SAV` file, because some may have issues for various reasons. Third, make sure your [`gba_db.bin`](resources/gba_db.bin) is up-to-date. If everything seems to be in order but the game still doesn't save properly, please [open an issue](https://github.com/profi200/open_agb_firm/issues) so it can be fixed. In the meantime, the `useGbaDb` and `saveOverride` settings may be useful (see [Configuration](#configuration) for more information).
